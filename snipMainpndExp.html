<b> Well, I got started with BASIC on my trusty Commodore 64 and then dabbled in other languages (C and Pascal) once I got my first PC.

But I couldn‚Äôt really wrap my head around C at first, so I spent a lot of time in QBasic for DOS. For some reason I was always really interested in assembly level languages, I really wanted to see what was going on behind the curtain (imagine how mind blown I felt when I later learned about CPU micro code‚Ä¶). And learning x86 assembly and writing a few programs in it made all of the C stuff like pointers and memory management ‚Äúclick.‚Äù C is basically a macro assembler with an odd syntax üôÇ

Eventually I discovered Delphi, which was (or still is?) sort of a combination of an OOP version of Pascal with an excellent GUI framework and a graphical editor. I wrote tons of software with that, like little games and utilities.

Delphi was simply amazing. I remember having to save up enough money so I could mail order the ‚Äúfull version‚Äù of the Delphi compiler and IDE‚Ä¶

Delphi‚Äôs standard library and its GUI framework taught me a lot about designing good APIs. Compared to the Win32 and MFC stuff that Microsoft was putting out at the time Delphi‚Äôs approach just seemed so much more beautiful. I loved working with Delphi.

Then after that I had a phase where I was obsessed with writing game engines. There was just something fascinating about how these game engines were almost little operating systems, with their own memory management, filesystem abstractions, and even little multi-threaded scripting runtimes.

Around that time I had access to the internet for the first time and I discovered that some of the Quake 1 source code was already open-source at the time.

You could download the source code for Quake‚Äôs scripting language compiler and the game logic from id Software‚Äôs FTP server. I ate that stuff up. Initially I had no idea what was going on, but I couldn‚Äôt put this code down. I printed it out and carried it around with me and scribbled down notes‚Ä¶ I learned so much from reading John Carmack‚Äôs code. He‚Äôs one of my heroes, I‚Äôd love to shake his hand one day and thank him for the impact he had on me as a coder.

So anyway, I was writing these little OpenGL renderers, scripting systems, and networking code and I just went deeper and deeper down these rabbit holes‚Äîwithout actually producing a playable game.

At some point I had built almost this ‚ÄúGame SDK‚Äù with my own VM-based scripting language and hot-reloading for code changes and a graphical map editor‚Äîbut there was practically no progress on the game I wanted to build (and that I had promised to my friends).

This experience taught me a lot about pragmatic design and program architecture. I got so tangled up in this mess (even though it was fun) that I made no actual progress on the things I said I was going to build. I‚Äôm sure most developers are familiar with this effect üòä

I don‚Äôt want to make this too long-winded‚Ä¶ So, long story short, at one point or another I got paid to write software in Java, Objective-C, JavaScript, CoffeeScript, Go, and Swift. During my university days I also got to dabble in Haskell and a few more esoteric languages like Prolog and OCaml.

Now to reel it all the way back in to Python:

Of course Python is my favorite programming language! I still remember when I thought about Python in those terms for the first time:

I was asked to re-write a terribly convoluted mess of a Java web application that was the API back-end for a mobile app. I rebuilt the whole thing in Python with Flask and SQLAlchemy. It took me about a month to do it and I used a test-first development style for everything.

The whole experience was just so enjoyable and felt so ‚Äúright‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt believe it at first. Since those days my love for Python never faded üôÇ
